About Tiny Scanner
=======================

This application provides a quick way to scan and store hand written notes and arts, and also shopping receipts and other documents. It also supports automatic capture of images on a pre-formatted page like a rocket book or pages consisting of QR codes.

How To Use:
- Simply aline the camera so that the angles are within the corners of the piece of paper
- Click on the camera once the paper is outlined (double clicking on the camera will take a picture even if a paper is not detected)
- That's it! You now have a saved version in your notes gallery ready for you 24/7 365!

Making Android applications is not my main job, I made this application out of curiosity and because there are dozens of apps with similar objectives but none of them are open source.

If you think that this application or any of my contributions is worth more, please feel free to buy me a coffee through Paypal.
